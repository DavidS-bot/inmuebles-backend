Alternative approach: Create a system where rules can be "global" and applied to all properties.

Instead of trying to sync all rules, let's create a better system where:
1. Some rules are property-specific (like tenant names)  
2. Some rules are global (like "SANTANDER" -> "Hipoteca")
3. Global rules are automatically available to all properties

This would require backend changes but would be more sustainable.

CURRENT ISSUE:
- Rules are created for specific properties only
- Each property shows only its own rules  
- Global rules page shows ALL rules but individual property pages show filtered rules
- Production backend may not have the same rules as local

PROPOSED SOLUTIONS:

1. SIMPLE FIX (Current approach):
   - Fix the API endpoint consistency (/classification-rules/ vs /classification-rules)
   - Ensure production backend has all the rules from local
   
2. GLOBAL RULES SYSTEM (Better long-term):
   - Add is_global field to rules
   - Global rules apply to ALL properties
   - Property-specific rules only apply to that property
   - Frontend shows both global + property-specific rules

3. RULE TEMPLATES SYSTEM (Most advanced):
   - Create rule templates (SANTANDER, IBI, COMUNIDAD, etc.)
   - When a new property is created, copy all template rules
   - Allow customization per property

RECOMMENDATION:
Start with solution #1 (fix endpoints + sync data) since it requires minimal changes.
Then consider solution #2 for future improvements.
